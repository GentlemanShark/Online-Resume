## About
My name is Stuart Trappe and I was born and raised in the Silicon Valley. That gave me the chance to explore the world of technology and business through my involvement with several startups and accelerators. It led to pursue a double major in Finance and Computer Science at the University of Arizona. My choice in majors allows me to see the higher level, big picture view of a business while still having core competencies in numerous technical areas. There, I am currently involved as a cohort leader for the PREMIER pre-business honorary, VP of the Consulting Club, FESO rep for the Eller Global Business Association, as an active member of the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity. With the skills I have gained from these experiences, I aim to work in strategy consulting for one of the big 3 consulting firms working with technology companies. Longer term, I believe I would transition to venture capital or a startup accelerator role working with small businesses looking to become bigger.
