## About
My name is Stuart Trappe and I was born and raised in the Silicon Valley. That gave me the chance to explore the world of technology and business through my involvement with several startups and accelerators. It led me to pursue a double major in Finance and Computer Science at the University of Arizona. My choice in majors corresponds with my desire to have a high level, big picture view of business while developing core technical competencies. There, I am currently involved as a cohort leader for the PREMIER pre-business honorary, VP of the Consulting Club, FESO rep for the Eller Global Business Association, and as an active member of the Alpha Kappa Psi professional business fraternity. With the skills I have gained from these experiences, I aim to work in strategy consulting for one of the big 3 consulting firms working with technology companies. Longer term, I can see myself making the transition to venture capital or a startup accelerator role working with small businesses looking to become bigger.

Outside of school, I am a big fan of all things automotive from my own involvments in racing to work on my vintage Mercedes. I also enjoy sailing, running, and anything that involves a little bit of danger. I am a big fan of reading and find it incredibly satisfying to do a deep dive into a completely unfamiliar subject. I spend my time between the San Franciso Bay Area and Tucson, Arizona, but am looking forward to relocating somewhere even more exciting after completing my undergrad.
