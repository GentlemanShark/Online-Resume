## About
I am a student at the University of Arizona currently intending to pursue a double major in Business Economics and MIS. With a background in computing and experiences with startups, I work well in environments ranging from small businesses to enterprises. In the past, I have worked at an IoT startup along with co-founding a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Through my time as presidents of clubs, CEOs of business competitions, and as a hackathon organizer, I have developed valuable leadership skills that I intend to apply to my work in the future. Those experiences lead me to realize my passion for the consulting industry as I found the process of problem solving in a variety of industries engaging.

Currently, I am in the PREMIER honorary, Zipperman Scholars Program, and Blue Chip Leadership which serve to develop my professionalism. Furthermore, I am the fundraising chair for the Eller Global Business Association and am involved in casing practice with the Arizona Consulting Club. My choice in majors allows me to see the higher level, big picture view of a business while still being able to dive into the nitty-gritty, technical details.

In the future, I can see myself working for a big three consulting firm. I enjoy the diveristy of clients they serve as well as the variety of problems I would be able to address. Longer term, I believe I would transition into a venture capital or startup acceleration role working with small businesses looking to become bigger.
