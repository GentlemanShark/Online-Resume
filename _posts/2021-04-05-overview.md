My name is Stuart Trappe and I am a student at the University of Arizona pursuing a double major in Finance and Computer Sicence. This website was created to serve as a digital professional persona profile as well as a repository for my projects, papers, and achievements. I have also intend to include blog posts on subjects that interest me or on books that I have read in the past.
