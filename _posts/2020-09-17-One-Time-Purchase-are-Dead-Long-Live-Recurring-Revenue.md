title: One Time Purchase are Dead, Long Live Recurring Revenue
---

## A Changing Dynamic
The long standing concept of product purchases has followed the model of a monetary transaction in exchange for lifetime access to a good. When you go to a hardware store to purchase a tool, you completely and entirely own the product. However, more and more companies are pivoting to the idea of access to a product on an often monthly or yearly basis.

## Who’s Involved?
Tech companies like Microsoft and Google have figured this out early. Microsoft Office is sold to consumers and enterprise through a subscription basis where a user never actually owns the product. Google follows through similarly with their cloud storage business that offers different tiers of storage at various monthly and yearly prices. Entire industries have risen out of this concept of licensing of software through subscriptions. Software as a service (SaaS) is also known as on-demand software and is growing at a rapid clip. Microsoft saw a 45% annual growth in their enterprise SaaS services in 2018. The industry as a whole was projected to grow 18% in 2019 to reach over $85 billion.

Some of the most profitable companies operate with this model. The most notable of which are Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Adobe. All four have the benefit of having significant enterprise clients who are willing to continue paying regularly for access to their services. The benefits of the recurring revenue model here are the ability to charge multiple times for the product and build loyalty through subscriptions. Additionally, their product overhead costs are quite low allowing them to make significant amounts of profit on each service sold.

This model is not exclusive just to tech companies with massive enterprise clients. The restaurant chain Panera launched a coffee subscription program where for $8.99 a month, a subscriber can get unlimited coffee. This is a brilliant move for two reasons: 1. Coffee is a extremely cheap item for them to sell and it gets more people in their stores 2. More foot traffic means more people purchases items that they originally would not have for the sake of convenience. For a consumer, the choice to subscribe is a no brainer. Being able to get a cup of coffee every month for $8.99 is an amazing deal. Even for those used to entrenched competitors like Starbucks, the comparative tradeoff is weighed significantly in favor of Panera on pricing alone. The consumers seem to agree as over 750,000 people have signed up for the service

## What does this mean?

It’s hard to tell exactly what this will entail and how wide spread recurring revenue will be. However, expect the most profitable companies in sectors like entertainment, technology, and commerce to deploy subscription models. Disney has demoed this with Disney+ and continued to do tests by having platform exclusive content. The longer term effect of this pricing model is a decline in individual ownership of products. Rather than owning software or content outright, it may become far more common for goods to be on a subscription or pay as you go model.
