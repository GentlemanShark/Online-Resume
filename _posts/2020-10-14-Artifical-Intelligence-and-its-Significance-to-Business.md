## What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence has been featured in the news in topics ranging from making self-driving cars possible to defeating chess grandmasters. Science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of robots in the first half of the 20th century. These robots were characteristic of being cold, heartless beings with humanoid appearances. Later, the first research of artificially created ‘brains’ began with Alan Turing’s postulation that just as how humans use information to make decisions, so can machines. The initial projects mimicked human reasoning and made simple decisions. The advent of increased data volumes, high level algorithm, and leaps in computing power have given rise to a new age of computers that leverage machine learning to be perform amazing tasks.

## The Financial Reasoning Behind Artificial Intelligence
The biggest change for business in the digital age is the ability to harness unprecedented levels of data. Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, stated “A billion hours ago, modern homo sapiens emerged. A billion minutes ago, Christianity began. A billion seconds ago, the IBM PC was released. A billion Google searches ago…was this morning.” More companies than ever harvest data from every aspect of their operations. These billions of searches are billions of lines of data from which Google uses to improve its services. In essence, data has value.

Artificial intelligence is able to improve itself through machine learning only when fed data. The companies that can generate the most and best data are the ones that on average, come out better on top. Increasing the amount of data inputted and the accuracy of this data is crucial to producing better predictions. 

Predictions are the basis upon which artificial intelligence is useful. Decision making is at the very soul of everything a business does. Decision making is enhanced by machine generated predictions combined with established economic models. Artificial intelligence has made decision making significantly cheaper and faster allowing more and more decisions to be made. This has allowed more intelligence decisions to be made in areas where decisions previously were not made. Such as in cases where the default was accepted. Cheaper means more and more entities can utilize it and faster means more aspects will be looked at than ever before

Prediction is the process of filling in missing information. It takes your data set, with the information you have, and creates information that you don’t have. We can see many real-world examples of this. For instance, take a credit card company that has to decide whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. There’s no information on hand that states unequivocally that it was made legitimately by a customer. However, prediction enables a business to use other data on hand, like the fact that the purchase was made on the other side of the country or that it was at a store that the customer never purchases from, to make an informed decision. This seemingly mundane process of accounting for gaps in information leads to the ‘magic’ behind applications of artificial intelligence like object recognition or computer powered language translation.


## Judgement and the Human Role in Prediction
This has risks and trade-offs, of course, which must be factored into any application of judgement. Good prediction needs to combine an understanding of judgement in order to understand the basis behind a decision making. Without weighing the resulting effects of a decision, artificial intelligence will fail to accurately account for every aspect of a situation.

While AI may seem frightening in how many roles and jobs it can encompass, only humans can provide judgement. Humans will do less of a combined prediction-judgement routine and instead, focus on a purely judgement-based role. This enables an interactive relationship between machine and human. This is a mutually beneficial shift as AI increases the value of understanding the rewards associated with actions through a lower cost of prediction. One must all consider the fact that determining relative payoffs for each of these actions is costly and requires significant experimentation involving time and effort.

Decisions often occur during times of uncertainty. Going back to the credit card transaction example, the company managing the card faces two decisions with four outcomes. Either the transaction is legitimate, and they allow it to go through and the customer is satisfied. Alternatively, the transaction is legitimate, and they block it out of fear of it being fraudulent. This wrong decision leads to the customer being unsatisfied and potentially not continuing to use our service. The other side is that they block a fraudulent transaction and the customer is quite happy that they were able to prevent it. However, if they make a wrong prediction and choose not to block a fraudulent transaction, the customer again could be significantly unsatisfied and switch to another company. The company has to weigh the payoff for acting on wrong decisions as well as right ones. They have to calibrate their predictions to understand this relationship to ensure that they are always making the best possible choice.

In some cases, the number of situations is small enough that this can be hard coded given enough information. In those instances, we can transfer the role of judgement to the AI (to learn more about this, look into “reward function engineering”). This essentially automates the process and gives the machine the ability to make a decision once it makes a prediction. Often times, this is not the case and it would be too costly to code all the payoffs associated with combinations of actions and situations, especially in one off scenarios.

## What Does this All Mean?
Artificial intelligence will have an ever-increasing role in nearly every aspect of life. It makes predictions cheaper and quicker allowing smarter decisions to be made. Modern businesses will leverage their capabilities to enhance every element of their strategy. Their ability to make decisions will further increase as will their applications. Human involvement will also increase and become more valuable as advanced judgement is needed.
