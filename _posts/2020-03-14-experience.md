My name is Stuart Trappe and I am a first year student intending to pursue a double major in Business Economics and MIS. Being from the Silicon Valley, startups and the tech industry have been a massive part of my life. I am interested in working in the tech industry in a higher level, more strategy oriented position. Professionally, I enjoy working in supply chain, targetted advertising, and taking a behavioral economics approach to understanding purchasing habits. Besides those pursuits, I am also passionate about skiing and sailing, activities I have been doing since I was a kid.
